Python Practice: Distance Between Points (Week 5)

The flight_paths.py function:
* takes in a starting and an ending city;
* returns a path between the two cities (including the two cities);
* also returns the total distance traveled between cities;
* appropriately handles the situation where no path exists.

A calculate_distance function is provided for the exercise along with a
JSON file contains some cities with international airports, each with a 
latitude, a longitude, and a city that it connects to.
