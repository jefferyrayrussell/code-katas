# Write a function sort_cards() that sorts a shuffled list of cards,
# so that any given list of cards is sorted by rank, no matter the
# starting collection.  All cards in the list are represented as strings,
# so that sorted list of cards looks like this:
# ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K'].

# Pseudo-Code

# Take in a list of unordered cards by type.
# Assign a numerical value to each.

card_face_list = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K']

card_values_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# Iterate through each card in the unsorted list and assign it a value
#  using if elif statements.
# Create a sorted list of the numerical values appending each card processed 
#  to that sorted list.
# Use the sorted method to resort the list.
# Translate the card value back into its key.
# Return the sorted list of card keys.


#  WRITE THE CODE IF TIME
