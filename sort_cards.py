# Write a function sort_cards() that sorts a shuffled list of cards,
# so that any given list of cards is sorted by rank, no matter the
# starting collection.  All cards in the list are represented as strings,
# so that sorted list of cards looks like this:
# ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K'].


# Assign each card above a priority value so that: A is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 3,
# 4 is 4, 5 is 5, 6 is 6, 7 is 7, 8 is 8, 9 is 9, T is 10, J is 11,
# Q is 12, K is 13.

# The numbered cards have their priority value equivalent to their face
# value.
